<p>Contributions are invited from prospective authors with interests in the indicated conference topics and related areas of application. Original research work may be submitted either as full papers (up to 10 pages) or short papers (up to 6 pages). Contributions are also invited in the category of review papers (up to 10 pages), which could summarise past research, identify current trends and project future possibilities. Review papers could cover either a domain, a group of users or a technology.</p>
<p>All contributions should be of high quality, original and not published elsewhere or submitted for publication during the review period. Submissions must be blinded for peer review (see the anonymisation guidelines below). Every submission must identify the theme which best relates to the contents of the paper. Papers will be peer reviewed by the International Program Committee and may be accepted for presentation.

<p class="top15">All papers in India IHCI 2013 will be categorized into three categories: Student, Industry, and Academic. In the “Student” category, the first author should be a student, whereas in “Industry” category, all authors should be from industries. The rest of the contributions would be considered in the “Academic” category. Both full paper (8-10 pages) and short paper (4-6 pages) would be considered. A best paper award will be given to the paper with extreme good quality. There is a fellowship and/or registration fee waiver for papers in the “Student” categories.</p>

<h2 class="top15">Templates and Guidelines:</h2>
<p>Submissions for all categories must be uploaded as a single MSWord or PDF file in the 
	<a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform">ACM SIGCHI format</a>, 
	[download <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-papers-latex-template/view" target="_blank">pdf</a> | 
	<a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-papers-word-template/view" target="_blank">word</a> ] using the 
	conference submission system (Refer 'Submission Process above'). All submissions must be 
	original and unpublished elsewhere. Any questions regarding the formatting and uploading 
	of submissions should be directed to <a href="mailto:indiahci2013@gmail.com">indiahci2013@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h2 class="top15">Review Process:</h2>

<p>We follow a double blind review process for India HCI. This means that during and after the
review process, the reviewers do not know who were the author(s) were, and the author(s) do
not know who reviewed their papers. At the time of submission, authors are expected to ensure
that their submissions have been blinded. Please remove individual and institutional identities
(author’s name, the name of university or company) from the title and header areas of the paper.
Changing the colour of the text is not enough. Also, please remove the meta data in the Word /
PDF files. Also remove acknowledgements and names of funding agencies. Authors will get an
opportunity to add back all the above information once the review process is complete when you
submit the camera ready version of your paper. Submissions that are not blinded will be
rejected automatically. However, authors should keep citations to all previous work including their own, so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account.
Authors should cite their own work in the third person, “As described by Dalvi et. al [4], …”.
Further suppression of your identity in the body of the paper (e.g. name of town / country,
participating institutions, photographs of researchers etc.) is left to author’s discretion.</p>

<h2 class="top15">Notification of Acceptance and Camera Ready Paper</h2>
<p>All authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by the dates mentioned against each category along with the review comments on their submissions. Based on the individual comments, authors will be instructed to submit the Camera Ready version of their submissions on or before the advertised dates against different categories. The accepted submissions must be presented at the conference by one of the authors. The presented works will be published in the joint India HCI 2013 and APCHI2013 conference proceedings and will appear in the ACM digital library.</p>
